Health check
This is the last part of the lab, where you will have to write a Python script named health_check.py that will run in the background monitoring some of your system statistics: CPU usage, disk space, available memory and name resolution. 
Moreover, this Python script should send an email if there are problems, such as:

     Report an error if CPU usage is over 80%
     Report an error if available disk space is lower than 20%
     Report an error if available memory is less than 500MB
     Report an error if the hostname "localhost" cannot be resolved to "127.0.0.1"
